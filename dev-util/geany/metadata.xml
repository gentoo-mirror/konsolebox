		Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
		It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
		few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
		independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
		or GNOME. So it is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need
		only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.

		The basic features of Geany are: syntax highlighting; code completion;
		auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while;
		auto completion of XML and HTML tags; call tips; many supported
		filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal; symbol lists.
