We created a configuration file for Tor, /etc/tor/torrc, but you can
change it according to your needs.  Use the torrc.sample that is in that
directory as a guide.  Also, to have privoxy work with Tor just add
'forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .' to /etc/privoxy/config.

If you plan to run Tor in chroot mode, please install net-vpn/tor with
chroot flag enabled, configure /etc/conf.d/tor-chroot, and run
'/etc/init.d/tor-chroot setup'.
