We created a configuration file for Tor, /etc/tor/torrc, but you can
change it according to your needs.  Use the torrc.sample that is in
that directory as a guide.  Also, to have privoxy work with Tor
just add the following line

forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .

to /etc/privoxy/config.  Notice the . at the end!

If you plan to run Tor in chroot, please install sys-apps/rcopy and see
/etc/conf.d/tor for details.
